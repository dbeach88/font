Yosemite
================
Yosemite is a theme for Google Chrome to match the user interface/design of Mac OS X 10.10 'Yosemite'. It themes the browser to blend in with the rest of OS X 10.10.

This theme is designed for and looks best with Mac OS X 10.10, but also works on older OS X versions and Chrome for Windows/Linux.
